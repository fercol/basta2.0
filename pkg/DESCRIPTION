Description: Estimates survival and mortality with covariates from census or capture-recapture/recovery data in a Bayesian framework when many individuals are of unknown age. It includes tools for data checking, model diagnostics and outputs such as life-tables and plots, as described in Colchero, Jones, Rebke (2012) <doi:10.1111/j.2041-210X.2012.00186.x> and Colchero \emph{et al.} (2021) <doi:10.1038/s41467-021-23894-3>.
