\title{
 BaSTA: Parametric Bayesian estimation of age-specific survival for truncated and censored capture-recapture or census data.
}

\description{
 This package estimates age-specific mortality and survival trajectories with covariates from capture-recapture/recovery or census data under a Bayesian framework when many individuals are of unknown age. It includes tools for data checking, model diagnostics, and outputs such as life-tables and plots.
