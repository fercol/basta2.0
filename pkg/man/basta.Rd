\title{
 Parametric Bayesian estimation of age-specific survival for left-truncated and 
right-censored capture-mark-recapture or census data.
}

\description{
 This function performs multiple Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations for the Bayesian estimation of age-specific mortality and survival when a large proportion of records have unknown times of birth and/or death. Survival parameters and unknown (i.e. latent) birth (and death, for CMR data) times are estimated, allowing the user to test a range of mortality patterns, and to test the effect of continuous and/or discrete covariates following Colchero and Clark's (2012) general approach.

\details{
\bold{1) DATA TYPES}

The input \code{object} required by BaSTA needs to be constructed differently whether the data are of capture-mark-recapture or census. 

\code{1.1) capture-mark-recapture (CMR):}

If \code{dataType} = \dQuote{\code{CMR}}, then the data frame requires the following structure. The first column is a vector of individual unique IDs, the second and third columns are birth and death years respectively. Columns \eqn{4, \dots, T+3} represent the observation window (i.e., recapture matrix) of \eqn{T} years. This is followed (optionally) by columns for categorical and continuous covariates (see \code{\link{bastaCMRdat}} for a CMR dataset example).

\code{1.2) Census:}

If \code{dataType} = \dQuote{\code{census}}, then the input data \code{object} requires at least five dates columns, namely \dQuote{Birth.Date}, \dQuote{Min.Birth.Date}, \dQuote{Max.Birth.Date}, \dQuote{Entry.Date}, and \dQuote{Depart.Date}. All dates need to be format as \dQuote{\%Y-\%m-\%d}. In addition, a \dQuote{Depart.Type} column is required with two types of departures \dQuote{C} for Censored and \dQuote{D} for dead (see \code{\link{bastaCensDat}} for a census dataset example).


\bold{2) AGE-SPECIFIC MORTALITY MODELS}

\code{basta} performs Bayesian inference on parametric age-specific mortality and survival when not all ages are known (Colchero and Clark 2012, Colchero \emph{et al.} 2012, Colchero \emph{et al.} 2021). The mortality function describes how the risk of mortality changes with age, and is defined as 
\deqn{
\mu(x | \theta) = \lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\Pr[x < X < x + \Delta x | X > x]}{\Delta x},
}
where \eqn{X} is a random variable for ages at death, \eqn{x \geq 0} are ages and \eqn{\theta} is the vector of mortality parameters. From the mortality function, the survival function is then given by
\deqn{
S(x | \bm{\theta}) = \exp[-\int_0^x \mu(t | \bm{\theta}) dt].
}

\code{2.1)}\code{Argument }\dQuote{\code{model}}\code{:}

The \code{model} argument allows the user to choose between four basic mortality functions, namely 

(a) \code{model = }\dQuote{\code{EX}}: The exponential model (Cox and Oakes 1974), with constant mortality with age, specified as

\deqn{\mu_b(x | \bm{\theta}) = b,}

where \eqn{b > 0}, with survival 
\deqn{
S_b(x | \bm{\theta}) = \exp[-b x].
}

(b) \code{model = }\dQuote{\code{GO}}: The Gompertz mortality model (Gompertz 1925, Pletcher 1999), calculated as 

\deqn{\mu_b(x | \bm{\theta}) = \exp(b_0 + b_1 x),}

where \eqn{-\infty < b_0, b_1 < \infty}, with survival
\deqn{
S_b(x | \bm{\theta}) = \exp\left[\frac{e^{b_0}}{b_1}\left(1 - e^{b_1 x}\right)\right].
}

(c) \code{model = }\dQuote{\code{WE}}: The Weibull mortality model (Pinder III \emph{et al.} 1978) calculated as

\deqn{\mu_b(x | \bm{\theta}) = b_0 b_1^{b_0} x^{b_0 -1},}

where \eqn{b_0, b_1 > 0}, with survival
\deqn{
S_b(x | \bm{\theta}) = \exp\left[-(b_1 x)^{b_0}\right].
}

(d) \code{model = }\dQuote{\code{LO}}: The logistic mortality model (Pletcher 1999), calculated as 

\deqn{\mu_b(x | \bm{\theta}) = \frac{\exp(b_0 + b_1 x)}{1 + b_2 \frac{e^{b_0}}{b_1} \left(e^{b_1 x}-1\right)},}
where \eqn{b_0, b_1, b_2 > 0}, with survival
\deqn{
S_b(x | \bm{\theta}) = \left[1 + b_2 \frac{e^{b_0}}{b_1} \left(e^{b_1 x} - 1\right)\right]^{-1 / b_2}.
}

\code{2.2)}\code{Argument }\dQuote{\code{shape}}\code{:}

The \code{shape} argument allows the user to extend these models in order to explore more complex mortality shapes. 

(a) \code{shape = }\dQuote{\code{simple}}: (default) Leaves the model as defined above, with mortality given by
\deqn{
\mu(x | \bm{\theta}) = \mu_b(x | \bm{\theta})
}
and survival
\deqn{
S(x | \bm{\theta}) = S_b(x | \bm{\theta}.
}

(b) \code{shape = }\dQuote{\code{Makeham}}: A constant is added to the mortality, such that the mortality is given by
\deqn{
\mu(x | \bm{\theta}) = c + \mu_b(x | \bm{\theta}_1),
}
where \eqn{\bm{\theta} = [c, \bm{\theta}_1]}, and with survival
\deqn{
S(x | \bm{\theta}) = e^{-cx} S_b(x | \bm{\theta}_1)
}

The most common models with this shape is the Gompertz-Makeham model (Gompertz 1825, Makeham 1866).

(c) \code{shape = }\dQuote{\code{bathtub}}: produces a concave shapes in mortality by adding a declining Gompertz term and a constant parameter to the basic mortality model, where the mortality function is
\deqn{
\mu(x | \bm{\theta}) = \exp(a_0 - a_1 x) + c + \mu_b(x | \bm{\theta}_1),
}
where \eqn{a_0 \in \mathbb{R}}, \eqn{a_1, c \geq 0} and \eqn{\bm{\theta}_1 \subset \bm{\theta}} are specified based on argument \code{model}, and with survival
\deqn{
S(x | \theta) = \exp\left[\frac{e^{a_0}}{a_1}\left(e^{a_1 x} - 1\right)-cx\right] S_b(x | \theta_1).
}

The most widely use \dQuote{\code{bathtub}} shaped model is the \bold{Siler mortality model} (Siler 1979), which provides considerably good fits to mammalian data. The arguments for the Siler model are:

\preformatted{basta(..., model = "GO", shape = "bathtub", ...)}


\bold{3) COVARIATES}

Covariates are selected by means of the argument \code{formulaMort}, which requires an object of class formula, just as with other statistical inference functions such as \code{lm} or \code{glm}.

When covariates are included in the dataset, the \code{basta} function provides three different ways in which these can be evaluated by using argument \code{covarsStruct}: 

\code{3.1)} \dQuote{\code{fused}}: 

This option will make the mortality parameters linear functions of all categorical covariates (analogous to a generalised linear model (GLM) structure) and will put all continuous covariates under a proportional hazards structure. Thus, for a simple exponential model with constant mortality of the form \eqn{\mu_0(x | b) = b}, the parameter is equal to \eqn{b = b_1 z_1 + \dots, b_k z_k}, where \eqn{[b_1, \dots, b_k]} are paramters that link the mortality parameter \eqn{b} with the categorical covariates \eqn{[z_1,\dots,z_k]}.

\code{3.2} \dQuote{\code{prop.haz}}: 

This setting will put all covariates under a proportional hazards structure irrespective of the type of variable. In this case, the mortality model is be further extended by including a proportional hazards structure, of the form 

\deqn{\mu(x | \theta, \gamma, Z_a, Z_c) = \mu_0(x | \theta, Z_a) \exp(Z_c \gamma),}

where \eqn{\mu_0(x | \theta, Z_a)} represents the baseline mortality as defined above, while the second term \eqn{\exp(Z_c \gamma)} corresponds to the proportional hazards function.  \eqn{Z_a} and \eqn{Z_c} are covariate (design) matrices for categorical and continuous covariates, respectively, while \eqn{\gamma} is a vector of proportional hazards parameters.

\code{3.3} \dQuote{\code{all.in.mort}}:

This specification will put all covariates as linear functions of the survival parameters as explained above. Since most models require the lower bounds for the mortality parameters to be equal to 0, the only model that can be used for this test is Gompertz with \code{shape} set to \dQuote{\code{simple}}. In case these arguments are specified differently, a warning message is printed noting that \code{model} will be forced to be \dQuote{\code{GO}} and \code{shape} will be set to \dQuote{\code{simple}}.

\bold{4) MCMC SETTINGS}

The \code{burnin} argument represents the number of steps at the begining of the MCMC run that is be discarded. This sequence commonly corresponds to the non-converged section of the MCMC sequence. Convergence and model selection measures are calculated from the remaining thinned parameter chains if multiple simulations are run, and all if all of them run to completion.

The \code{thinning} argument specifies the number of steps to be skipped in order to reduce serial autocorrelation. The thinned sequence, which only includes steps after burn in, is then used to calculate convergence statistics and model for selection.

The \code{updateJumps} argument specifies wether to run a simulation to find appropriate jump standard deviations for theta and gamma parameters. If argument \dQuote{\code{nsim}} is set to 1, then the simulation runs with the update jumps routine active. If \dQuote{\code{nsim}} is larger than 1, then an initial simulation is ran to find apropriate jumps before the main analysis is ran. 

\bold{5) ADDITIONAL ARGUMENTS}

Additional arguments for priors, jumps and start values can be passed on the \dots section. For instance, argument \code{thetaStart} can be specified as a vector defining the initial values for each parameter in the survival model. If this argument is not specified, a set of random parameters is generated for each simulation. Similarly, argument \code{gammaStart} can be specified for all parameters in the proportional hazards section of the model. Jump standard deviations (i.e. the standard error in the Metropolis step) can be specified with arguments \code{thetaJumps} and \code{gammaJumps}. As with \code{thetaStart}, default values are assigned if these arguments are not specified. 

To specify priors, arguments \code{thetaPriorMean}, \code{thetaPriorSd}, \code{gammaPriorMean} and \code{gammaPriorSd} can be used for prior means and standard errors for each survival and proportional hazards parameters. If not specified, default values are assigned.

The number of parameters in \code{thetaStart}, \code{thetaJumps}, \code{thetaPriorMean} and \code{thetaPriorSd} should be a vector or matrix for the parameters in the mortality function. The number of parameters will depend on the model chosen with \code{model} (see above). If the number of parameters specified does not match the number of parameters inherent to the model and shape selected, the function returns an error. 

As described above, the number of parameters for \code{gammaStart}, \code{gammaJumps}, \code{gammaPriorMean} and \code{gammaPriorSd} arguments (i.e. section b), namely the proportional hazards section, will be a function of the number of continuous covariates if argument \code{covarsStruct} is \dQuote{\code{fused}}, or to the total number of covariates when \code{covarsStruct} is \dQuote{\code{prop.haz}}.

%Another additional argument is \code{returnAges}, which outputs a value \code{estAges}, which is a matrix with all estimated ages after the burnin and thinning. This matrix also includes ages that were known, thus each row corresponds to the individual in the same row as the original dataset.

\bold{6) SUMMARY STATISTICS}

From the converged sequence of mortality parameters, BaSTA calculates a number of summary statistics, their standard errors and their lower and upper 95\% credible intervals. 

\code{6.1) Remaining life expectancy:}

The function calculates remaining life expectancy as
\deqn{
e_{0} = \int_{0}^{\infty} S(t) dt.
}

\code{6.2) Measures of inequality and equality:}

The function calculates different measures of inequality and equality in the distribution of ages at death that results from the parametric model:

- \code{Lifespan inequality:} (Demetrius 1974, Keyfitz and Caswell 2005) given by

\deqn{
H = -\frac{\int_{0}^{\infty} S(x) \ln [S(x)] dx}{e_0}
}

- \code{Lifespan equality:} (Colchero \emph{et al.} 2016, Colchero \emph{et al.} 2021) given by

\deqn{
\varepsilon = - \ln H.
}

- \code{Gini coefficient:} (Gini 1912, Shkolnikov \emph{et al.} 2003) given by

\deqn{
G = 1 - \frac{1}{e_0} \int_0^{\infty} [l(x)]^2 dx
}

- \code{Coefficient of variation:} given by

\deqn{
CV = \frac{\sqrt{\sigma^2}}{e_0},
}
